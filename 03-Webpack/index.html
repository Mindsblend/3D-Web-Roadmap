    <h1>What is a bundler</h1>
    <p>
        A bundler is a tool in which you send assets like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, TypeScript, Stylus, and other languages. The bundler will handle those assets, apply potential modifications, and output a "bundle" composed of web friendly files like HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see that like a pipe in which you send non-web-friendly assets and, at the end of the tube, you get web-friendly assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bundler can do even more. You can use a bundler to create a local server, manage dependencies, improve compatibility, support modules, optimize images, deploy on a server, minify the code, etc.
